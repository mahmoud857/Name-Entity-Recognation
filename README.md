# Name-Entity-Recognation
Named Entity Recognition (NER) Project

This repository contains a Python-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) project using spaCy, a popular Natural Language Processing (NLP) library. The project demonstrates how to extract named entities (such as names, locations, organizations, dates, etc.) from text data.

# Overview

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that identifies and classifies named entities in text into predefined categories such as:

PERSON: People's names.

ORG: Organizations, companies, agencies, etc.

GPE: Geopolitical entities (countries, cities, states).

DATE: Dates or time expressions.

MONEY: Monetary values.

# This project uses spaCy, a powerful NLP library, to perform NER on text data.
